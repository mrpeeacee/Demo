1. Certicate.pem
2. Private Key
3. CA bundle/Chain/Root certificate

once we have this browse "https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-certificate-tools.html"

in that SSL tools --> certificate decoder

 in the choose file field 

1> Certificate.pem
2> Private Key
3> CA bundle/Chain

keep the password simple and easy to remember
